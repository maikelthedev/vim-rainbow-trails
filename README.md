# ðŸŒˆ Rainbow Trails

TRANSFORM your BORING, regular Vim cursor into a delightful UNICORN that scatters RAINBOW dust as it GALLOPS around the buffer.[^1]

Fork from: [sedm0784/vim-rainbow-trails](https://github.com/sedm0784/vim-rainbow-trails)

![A short Vim session. Vim is showing the :help page for the Rainbow Trails plugin. The command :Rainbow Trails is entered, and then the cursor is moved rapidly around the window, leaving rainbows behind it as it zips about.](https://normalmo.de/plugins/images/rainbow-trailser.gif)
