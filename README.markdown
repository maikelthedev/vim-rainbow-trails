# ðŸŒˆ Rainbow Trails

TRANSFORM your BORING, regular Vim cursor into a delightful UNICORN that scatters RAINBOW dust as it GALLOPS around the buffer.[^1]

![A short Vim session. Vim is showing the :help page for the Rainbow Trails plugin. The command :Rainbow Trails is entered, and then the cursor is moved rapidly around the window, leaving rainbows behind it as it zips about.](https://normalmo.de/plugins/images/rainbow-trailser.gif)

## I want Rainbows! How do I get them?!

Install with your normal package manager, or just use Vim's built in [packages](https://vimhelp.org/repeat.txt.html#packages) feature:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start
    git clone https://github.com/sedm0784/vim-rainbow-trails.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start

Then run `:helptags ALL` in Vim to generate the [documentation](doc/rainbow-trails.txt), and `:RainbowTrails` to start the FUN.

[^1]: Unicorn not included.

## How to install in LazyGit

1. Create a file inside the plugins folder with:

```lua
  {
    "sedm0784/vim-rainbow-trails",
    enabled = true, 
    lazy = false
  }
```

If you want it to autoload put this on your init file

```lua  
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("BufEnter", { command = ":RainbowTrails", })

```

## Install in NvChad

Add the lines above in your .config/nvim/lua/custom/plugins.lua list 
Put the autoload if required on your .config/nvim/lua/custom/chadrc.lua file

Enjoy!
